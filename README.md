### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: "Are philosophies sustainable?"
+ This project is conducted by [Ashwathi Prakash Nair]

+ Project summary: I have conducted a Text mining Analysis of the 'History of Philosophy' dataset from Kaggle. I have done so using School wise wordclouds based on thought processes and sentiment analysis to study the positiveness of the same. I have attempted to understand which schools have passed the test of time.
